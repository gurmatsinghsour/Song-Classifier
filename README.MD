# Lyric Genre & Content Classifier

Welcome to our **Lyric Genre & Content Classifier** project!  
This tool uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning to predict a song’s **genre** and **emotional tone** based on its lyrics.

---

## How to Run the Project

Simply **double-click `run.bat`** or run it via terminal:

```
run.bat
```

This script handles:
1. Checking if Python is installed.
2. Creating a virtual environment (if not already present).
3. Installing required dependencies (if not already installed).
4. Downloading NLTK’s VADER sentiment lexicon.
5. Training the model (if not already trained).
6. Launching the Flask API in a new window.
7. Opening the web UI located at `templates/index.html`.

> If you've already set up the project, running the batch file again will simply **start the API and frontend**, no redundant setup.

## Project Overview

The project is an NLP-powered classifier that analyzes a song’s lyrics to:
- **Predict the genre** using machine learning (Logistic Regression pipeline).
- **Analyze sentiment** using VADER sentiment analysis.

We preprocessed lyrics datasets, vectorized the text, and built a custom classifier that runs via a web-based UI.
